<H2> Welcome and Get Ready to Try</H2>
<p> Hi , Everyone welcome to my page for some
Easy Indian recipies. </p>
<p>I am adding information that I have used personally to survive (not kidding), really to survive when I moved
out on my own. And Guess What?? Did not know how to cook anything else but Maggie...</p>
</br>
<p> I know we all have been there. And Some of us are going through this phase as I am writing right now. So
I have decided to make an effort and share some recipes with all of you. I won't lie and say
That these are my grandmother's recipes. Because the truth is "They are not". These are some of the basic
everyday food recipes that I picked up online and found easier to learn.
Everyday there is something new to learn and something new to share.
Knowledge increases by sharing. You are welcome to share your cooking ideas,
recipes, simple tips and other suggestions..</p>
